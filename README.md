# DjangoRestFramework-AJAX CRUD ShapeApp

Basic CURD using Django Rest Framework with AJAX integrated application.

## Getting Started
This web app is developed for 2 user roles:
1. Admin
2. Normal User

Shape information is entered and saved by Admin and Normal User will be able to get the updated real time data. CRUD is developed by using AJAX request and handled by Django Rest Framework.
